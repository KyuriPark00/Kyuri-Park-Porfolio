# Kyuri-Park-Porfolio
This is a portfolio website created to showcase projects and skills. The site uses HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, responsive experience for users. It includes sections like "About Me" and "Projects" with hover effects, animations, and media queries for mobile responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

* PHP

## Installation
